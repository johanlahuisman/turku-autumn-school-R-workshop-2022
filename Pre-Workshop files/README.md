# Pre-Workshop files

In this folder you will find the files that accompany the instruction videos on Moodle. There are two videos:

1.  *Introduction to R Markdown*
  - Here we will go over some of the basic elements that will help you structure and format the output of your R Markdown file
2.  *Basic Programming in R*
  - Here we will go over some of the basic concepts that are used in computer programming, such as assigning variables, different types of variables, different types of data structures, etc. Familiarity with these concepts will make it easier to follow along with the data wrangling we will be doing in the workshop

For each of the videos, you will find the original R Markdown file I used (with some additional comments), as well as the knitted HTML file for easy viewing.
