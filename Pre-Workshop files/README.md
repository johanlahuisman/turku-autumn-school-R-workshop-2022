# Pre-Workshop files

In this folder you will find the files that accompany the instruction videos on Moodle. There are two videos:

- Introduction to R Markdown
- Basic Programming in R

For each of the videos, you will find the original R Markdown file I used (with some additional comments), as well as the knitted HTML file.
